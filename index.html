                    <h3>Fundamentals</h3>
                    <p>Although I have experience in practical implementation, I have in-depth understanding of commonly used design 
                        systems, methodologies and practises. I am able to adapt to new concepts quickly, and am familiar with architecture patterns,
                        multi-layer architecture, agile development, concurrent and parallel programming - to name a few.

                    <h3>Backend</h3>
                    <p>I have three years undergraduate experience with backend development principles, design and execution.
                    I aim to create code that is highly efficent and easy to read. I religiously follow coding best-practises, 
                    constantly refining and refactoring existing code ensuring it is readable, useful <em>and</em> reusable.

                    <h3>Frontend</h3>
                    <p>I have thorough understanding of basic front-end coding principles and practise. I am well-versed 
                        in good design practise. My websites are goal-oriented, and drive users towards completing a desired action.
                        I am constantly ensuring my websites are fully functional and user-friendly.

                    <h3>User experience design</h3>
                    <p> I am proficient in analysing human behaviour and solving problems in a unique way with practical and strategic design skills. 
                        I am able to take a project from the conceptual stage into interactive prototyping and further into a working front-end final version.
                        Designs are ergonomic and straightforward - while remaining inspiring and refreshing.
